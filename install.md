# [Codey](https://unicornyrainbow.github.io/Codey)

Thank you for installing Codey! There are multiple ways to install it:

## Graphical
Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/UnicornyRainbow/Codey/releases/latest) and download the correct file for your cpu architecture (if you are not sure, give codey.flatpak a try).\
Then open the file in your file manager and double click it, it should open your graphical package manager /software store, then click on install.

## Command Line
Download it with
* `wget https://github.com/UnicornyRainbow/Codey/releases/latest/download/codey.flatpak` for x86
* `wget https://github.com/UnicornyRainbow/Codey/releases/latest/download/codey_aarch.flatpak` for aarch
then install it
* `sudo flatpak install codey.flatpak` or
* `sudo flatpak install codey_aarch.flatpak`

## Build it on your own
Download the the source code from the [latest release](https://github.com/UnicornyRainbow/Codey/releases/latest), then unpack it and open a terminal in the folder.\
To always have the most current (maybe not stable) version, run `git clone https://github.com/UnicornyRainbow/Codey`, then `cd Codey`.

Now that you have a terminal opened in the folder with source code, make the build script executable `chmod +x flatpak_build.sh`, then run it `./flatpak_build.sh`.
It builds a .flatpak file you can distribute and also installs it on your system.
